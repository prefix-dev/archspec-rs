An implementation of [archspec](https://github.com/archspec/archspec) in Rust.

Archspec aims at providing a standard set of human-understandable labels for various aspects of a system architecture like CPU, network fabrics, etc. and APIs to detect, query and compare them.

The original archspec project grew out of [Spack](https://spack.io/) and is currently under active development. 
At present it supports APIs to detect and model compatibility relationships among different CPU microarchitectures.
